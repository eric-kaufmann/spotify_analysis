# Spotify Analysis

## Abstract
In this project report, two Spotify datasets from Kaggle were merged and then analyzed. The features of songs were considered by dividing them into playlists. By creating a new metric for determining popularity, the characteristics of popular songs can be determined and compared. In addition, various properties were evaluated over the years (1900-2020). This made it possible to show that music became more energetic and intense and this brought great popularity.
